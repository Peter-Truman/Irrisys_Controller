IRRISYS Irrigation Controller - Continuation Prompt

CONTEXT:
Working on PIC18F2525-based irrigation controller. RTC-based 1Hz timer infrastructure is now complete and verified working.

CURRENT STATE:
✅ DS3231M RTC configured for 1Hz square wave output
✅ INT0 interrupt working on RB0 (falling edge)
✅ rtc_second_counter increments every second (0-604800, rolls over at 1 week)
✅ Logic analyzer verified clean 1Hz pulses
✅ System stable, no lockups

HARDWARE:
- RB0 has 4.7kΩ pullup to +5V
- 500ms startup delay before rtc_init() required for oscillator stabilization
- RTC VBAT connected to +5V via supercap circuit

NEXT TASKS:
1. Implement runtime tracking for pump/relay operation
2. Use rtc_second_counter for irrigation duration timing
3. Add maximum runtime protection (configurable limit in seconds)
4. Display runtime on LCD during pump operation
5. Log/store runtime events

CODE BASE LOCATIONS:
- RTC driver: src/rtc.c, include/rtc.h
- Main loop: src/main.c
- ISR: src/encoder.c (INT0 handler at top of isr() function)
- Relay control: trigger_relay_pulse() in main.c

CRITICAL NOTES:
- Never read RTC registers in main loop (causes I2C lockup)
- INT0 interrupt must remain enabled for counter to work
- Counter is volatile and interrupt-driven
- Use rtc_reset_counter() to reset when needed

Ready to implement runtime tracking and pump protection features using the 1Hz counter.
